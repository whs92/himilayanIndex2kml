# himilayanIndex2kml
An application to parse data from the Alpine Club Himilayan Index and create a .kml file which can be opened in google earth.

MOUNTAIN.txt contains information on peak name, location and altitude. It's this data that I will work on first. Each peak also 
has a unique MtNumber which is used to ascociate it with other data. There are just under 3.3K entries.
